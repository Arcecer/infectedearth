# Legally Distinct John: The Game (no actual name yet sorry)
 Platformer where I'm just going to throw in whatever ideas I feel like adding.
## KNOWN ISSUES
 -Sometimes after jumping you won't be affected by gravity until your next jump
## STUFF THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN ISSUE BUT REALLY ISN'T
 -No speed limit for jumping - this was meant to be sort of like bunnyhopping in Quake, although I'm not too sure if it works for a 2D platformer (i don't care though it's cool!!)
