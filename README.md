# Infected Earth (a game!!!)
 Platformer where I'm just going to throw in whatever ideas I feel like adding.
## KNOWN ISSUES
 -none!!! (until they are known of course)
## STUFF THAT MIGHT SEEM LIKE AN ISSUE BUT REALLY ISN'T
 -No speed limit for jumping - this was meant to be sort of like bunnyhopping in Quake, although I'm not too sure if it works for a 2D platformer (i don't care though it's cool!!)
## STUFF OF DEBATABLE ISSUE-NESS
 -While in mid-air you can still jump as long as you haven't already - this was unintentional but I like it
